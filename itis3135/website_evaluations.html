        <section>
            <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></h3>
            <p>This site is amazon.com and it's a very popular site commonly used to make purchases of a wide variety of resources, which can include clothes, appliances, books, etc. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: This site uses contrast very effectively as the color of the text always contrasts the color of the button or the background. For example, if the background-color is dark, the text color is light and vice versa. This is very effective as it makes everything readable to the users.</li>
                <li>Repetition: This site also does a good job with repetition. Coming to colors, they have dark blue/almost black at the very top and the very bottom. Right under the top and above the bottom where the search bar and the address all are, they have navy blue. They have mostly just white in all other areas. Coming to font, they have the same font but just different sizes throughout, and mostly just black and white font colors.</li>
                <li>Alignment: The alignment in this site also looks immaculate since different sections are broken up into their own rectangle in the middle of the homepage, while still lining up with one another. All the headers also line up with each other and it doesn't look like they're out of place. </li>
                <li>Proximity: Related sections like "Pick up where you left off," "Keep shopping for," and "Buy Again" are closer together as all those sections are related. They are also aligned very well as the top and bottom of each of the sections are on the same level. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
            <p>This site is art.yale.edu and it's the official website for the School of Arts at Yale University</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: Out of the 4 CRAP principles that apply to a website that's considered well structured, contrast might be the only one that applies to this website and only to an extent. The contrast between the text size and background-color in this website makes the text easy to read. However, it doesn't look professional at all.</li>
                <li>Repetition: There's not much repetition in this website and it feels like there are multiple different font sizes and colors throughout. Out of nowhere, certain things are underlined and shaded in either white or black which isn't necessary. This aspect doesn't make the website look like the official Yale School of Arts website one bit.</li>
                <li>Alignment: The alignment in this website looks really bad as everything is just all over the place and everything just looks thrown together, which makes this website look really messy and unprofessional.</li>
                <li>Proximity: Everything in this website looks so out of order and it doesn't feel like similar elements are grouped together or even in somewhat close proximity to one another.</li>
            </ul>
