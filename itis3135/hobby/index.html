                <p>This hobby is working out, which covers a broad range of activities including weightlifting, powerlifting, strength training, calisthenics, cardio, etc. Not only does working out make one look bigger, but it also boosts their physical health. The beauty of working out lies in the versatility, due to the various forms of workouts that exist for various needs. </p>
                <p>Although it's commonly known that working out boosts physical health, its benefits on mental health are overlooked. Research shows that exercise reduces anxiety, depression, and other mental health related disorders. Working out helps people feel more positive and confident about their everyday life. </p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>
                <figure></figure>
                <p>My name is Arjun Mamidala and I'm a private fitness trainer passionate about helping people achieve their fitness goals. I have around 10 years of experience now and have achieved the American Council on Exercise(ACE) and the International Sports Sciences Association(ISSA) certificatons. Training people is something that brings me a lot of joy because I want people to be able to experience the satisfication of achieving their goals. </p>
                <p>In addition to one-on-one training, I offer group classes and online coaching, to make it easier for long distance people that can't meet in person on a regular basis. Depending on one's goals, I create a program consisting of the workout and diet plan. This includes the list of exercises, foods, calories, and how much sleep is recommended. </p>

            <h2>Schedule</h2>
            <h3>
                <figure></figure>
                <p>There isn't really a set best time to workout as it depeneds on the individual and when they prefer to. This can also depend on various other factors such as their sleep and daily schedule. </p>
                <p>More than the time that an individual goes to the gym, it's essential that they maintain consistency in working out, eating a clean diet consisting of a good balance of protein, carbs, and fats, and sleeping 7-9 hours per night. </p>

        <section id="where">
            <h2>Where</h2>
            <h3>
                <figure></figure>
                <p>Where an individual prefers to workout depends on their own personal needs. If the goal is to lose weight, this can be done by running on a treadill or in the local park. With losing weight, the most important thing is to make sure that you're eating a clean diet and within a calorie deficit. </p>
                <p>if the goals are more related towards getting bigger or stronger, it might be helpful to get a gym subscription or even do calisthenics at home. Coming to the specific gym, this can depend on the amount of equipment available as well as the membership plans and prices. </p>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How</h2>
            <h3>
                <figure></figure>
                <p>As a starting point, it's always important to know that no one cares how much weight you do in the gym as everyone if focused on themselves. Repping maximum weight should also not be one's goal when entering the gym. It's important to perfect the form first and know that if one exercise is causing injuries, then DONT DO IT. It's better to switch it out with a different exercise that trains the muscles in a similar way. </p>
                <p>We are here to help you perfect your form and determine which workouts are best for your goals. Along with us, there are many other trainers and helpful videos online that teach you how to perform an exercise the right way, which will help you grow and avoid injuries. </p>

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why</h2>
            <figure></figure>
            <p>There are many reasons why someone would want to make working out a habit, whether this is to enhance their physical health or to just feel better and more confident about themselves. Regardless of what the motive is, I am always here to help you achieve your goals and there are various other resources out there.  </p>
            <p>Sometimes, working out can simply function as a healthy distraction. Regardless of the reason, working out is a form of self-care and is essential in better many aspects of someone's life. </p>
