                <p>This hobby is working out, which covers a broad range of activities including weightlifting, powerlifting, strength training, calisthenics, cardio, etc. Not only does working out make one look bigger, but it also boosts their physical health. The beauty of working out lies in the versatility, due to the various forms of workouts that exist for various needs. </p>
                <p>Although it's commonly known that working out boosts physical health, its benefits on mental health are overlooked. Research shows that exercise reduces anxiety, depression, and other mental health related disorders. Working out helps people feel more positive and confident about their everyday life. </p>
